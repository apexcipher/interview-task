# Accountancy Cloud Technical Task

This task is designed to test your basic coding & problem-solving skills. You have as long as you like to complete it but we expect a Senior Developer to finish it in just under an hour.

The task will test your knowledge of JavaScript and your ability to write readable, well-performing code.

Please try to avoid using libraries. You may use online resources for general help with syntax, techniques etc but please don't copy code.

To submit the completed task, please create a public fork of this repository with your changes and send us the link. Alternatively you may send us a zipped directory with the files contained.

## The Task

Using the code contained in app.js as a starting point, create a function (or set of functions) that renders a table from the transactions in the array.

The table must have the following columns:
- Name
- Amount
- Date (formatted as day/month/year)
- Categories
- Percentage of Total

By default the table must be sorted by date in descending order. 

You must also be able to search the transactions by name and category using the input provided.

All amounts must be formatted to 2 decimal places.

We're big fans of TDD and we'd like you to take this approach when completing the task.
